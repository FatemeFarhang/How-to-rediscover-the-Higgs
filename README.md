# How-to-rediscover-the-Higgs 
## Jupyter notebook with steps to rediscover the Higgs boson yourself!

Hi!
This is our forked repository from the [original repository](https://github.com/meevans1/How-to-rediscover-the-Higgs).

Here we try to use the Cern Open Data to see how the Higgs boson has been discovered!</br>
And we added a little observation on the effects of cuts on ML performance.
